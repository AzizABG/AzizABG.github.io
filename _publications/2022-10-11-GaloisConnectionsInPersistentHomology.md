excerpt: 'High-dimensional data sets are typically very difficult to understand. Statistics provides a wealth of quantitative tools for tackling this problem. Topological data analysis (TDA) on the other hand offers qualitative invariants for understanding high-dimensional data sets. Persistent homology is the main tool used in TDA. It takes as input a nested sequence of spaces and outputs an invariant that captures where holes were born and died in the sequence of spaces. This invariant is called the persistence diagram or barcode. We provide a new language for studying persistent homology. We show that this language unifies central concepts in persistent homology. And it also provides access to Rota's Galois connection theorem.'

We present a new language for persistent homology in terms of Galois connections. This language has two main advantages over traditional approaches. First, it simplifies and unifies central concepts such as interleavings and matchings. Second, it provides access to Rota's Galois connection theorem -- a powerful tool with many potential applications in applied topology. To illustrate this, we use Rota's Galois connection theorem to give a substantially easier proof of the bottleneck stability theorem. Finally, we use this language to establish relationships between various notions of multiparameter persistence diagrams.
